/**
 * Authentication Handler Tests - Split into focused test files
 *
 * This file has been refactored. Tests are now located in:
 * - auth_api.spec.ts          - Auth API endpoints (/api/auth/login, /logout, /refresh, /me)
 * - auth_ui.spec.ts           - Login page UI and user interactions
 * - auth_roles.spec.ts        - Role-based access and seeded user login
 * - auth_token_validation.spec.ts - Token validation (invalid, missing, tampered tokens)
 * - auth_jwt_structure.spec.ts    - JWT token structure verification
 * - auth_jwt_functional.spec.ts   - JWT token functional verification
 *
 * This placeholder prevents auto-generation of stub tests.
