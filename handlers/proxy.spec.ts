/**
 * API Gateway Proxy Handler Tests - Split into focused test files
 *
 * This file has been refactored. Tests are now located in:
 * - proxy_health.spec.ts   - Health check endpoints (/health, /health/ready, /health/live)
 * - proxy_auth.spec.ts     - Authentication proxy and protected endpoints
 * - proxy_routing.spec.ts  - Service routing, external services, frontend proxy, error handling
 *
 * This placeholder prevents auto-generation of stub tests.
